##Intoduction
Despite all the efforts from companies such as youtube and mixer, twitch.tv's streaming platform dominance still seems unstoppable, which is really strange comsidering all the scandals regarding banning people for doing comparatively nothing much. 
This has to end one time or another, so this is the most ambitious project to do that yet.

##Our plans to conquer the world
We want to build a streaming platform, that will be useful for everyone, not only for gaming.
Though we intend to keep our content level high, so don't expect any periscope-level questionable stuff.
All that will be streamed on this platform shall be of high quality, interesting and you probably won't get banned for it, unless you go to far of course.
